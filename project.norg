* Overview

  eletask (elegant task) is a TaskWarrior "wrapper" for prettier printing and easy parsing. 

** Goals

   - TaskWarrior can be hard to quickly parse with the eyes, it's visually noisy. 
     This project should improve this and make nice looking lists.
   - A full featured TUI that adds some QOL and makes it a breeze to manage your tasks.

** Libraries

   - https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui

* Broad Todo

  - ( ) Fix parsing to handle UDA's
  - ( ) Add subtasks
